# MA678_Midterm_Project
In this project, I want to use the dataset Sales of summer clothes in E-commerce Wish from Kaggle, which has a strong connection with my career goal.  With the development of society, more and more people tend to choose online shopping. I want to know reasons to lead one to make the shopping decision when they do online shopping. Unlike shopping in stores, online shopping has its unique characteristics, people not only consider the product itself, products ratings and sales performance may also change oneâ€™s mind of whether or not buying this product. People will have a more comprehensive comparison when they shopping online. Although in this project, my research is specific for the wish website, my project has universality for online shopping, because the dataset in this project covers those unique characteristics for online shopping.
